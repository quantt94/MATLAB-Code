# MATLAB-Code
All is coded in Matlab

* Credit Risk branch applied Machine Learning model named Bootstrapping Regression to predict the default event in the next year <br /> 
Also generating heatmap to learn how tight the correlation between events (one happened could cause the other to happen) <br />
<br />
* In Portfolio Optimization branch, CPlex from IBM developer and IPOPT optimization tools were used to solve linear or non-linear, no constraints or one-to-more constraints optimization problem <br />
<br />
* In Simulation and Graphing branch, loops were utilized to generate different scenario paths, loops in plot also been deployed to create general look of patterns
